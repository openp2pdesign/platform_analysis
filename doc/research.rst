Research
=============================================

*platform_analysis* is based on several years of experimentation, which lead to the development of the module only in 2016.

The research leading to these results started in 2012 while Massimo Menichinelli worked at Aalto Media Factory in the Aalto University; the research continued while working as a lecturer at SUPSI during 2013-15. These first informal tests were later elaborated into a full software library and full analysis while working at IAAC | Fab City Research Lab in 2016-17 within the Horizon 2020 project MAKE-IT. The finalization of this research has
received funding from the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Union within the MAKE-IT project under grant agreement n° 688241. This publication reflects only the author’s view and the Union is not liable for any use that may be made of the information contained therein.
